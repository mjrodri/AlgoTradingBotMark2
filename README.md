# Improved Trading Bot

This repository contains an improved version of a simple trading bot script that fetches historical forex data using the yfinance library. The improvements aim to enhance code readability, organization, and maintainability.

## Changes Made

1. **Descriptive Variable Names:**
   - The variable names such as `symbol`, `start_date`, `end_date`, and `data` have been chosen to be more descriptive, making the code easier to understand.

2. **Consolidated Download Parameters:**
   - The download parameters for yfinance have been directly incorporated into the `yf.download` function call, simplifying the code and making it more concise.

3. **Improved DataFrame Access:**
   - Utilized a more consistent and readable method to access the last row of the DataFrame (`data.iloc[-1:, :]`) and the 'Open' column (`last_row['Open'].values[0]`).

4. **Printed Result for Visibility:**
   - The result, in this case, the last open price, is now printed for better visibility and user feedback.
